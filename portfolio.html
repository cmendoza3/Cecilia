<pre> 
Purpose:The purpose of the story is to make choices that will enable the user to successfully escape out of jail. 
        The story is interactive for the user. For instance, the user uses the mouse by clicking on the choice he/she 
        wants. Their choices will affect the outcome of the story. 

Components:The program had algorithms incorporated into it. An algorithm is a series of steps, and it also involved 
           logical concepts because it was composed of "if-else" statements. A condition happened depending if it was
           a true or false statement. To simplify the complexity of the program abstraction was used for the sprites. 
           The abstraction broke the code into separate parts in order to work more efficiently. The overall story is
           made up of different acts that have different outcomes. 
           
Knowledge: Throughout this project, I learned how to manage my time. A new concept I learned was abstraction. I became 
           aware abstraction was used in a complex situation in order to create simpler commands. In this project, one 
           of its strenghts is that it requires uses interaction. The project is also able to complete the task. One of 
           the weaknesses within this project is that most of the code was similar. In addition I also learned that for 
           the next project, I should attempt to use a greater variation of code and try new things.
           
Future: Potential plans for the future to improve this game are to incorporate more algorithms and make the story plot
        more challenging. The idea behind making the story plot more difficult is to expand the story and enable users 
        to use their critical thinking skills.
