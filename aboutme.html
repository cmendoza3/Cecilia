<h1><font size="7">This is my About me Page! </font> </h1>
<p> <font size="5"> My name is Cecilia Mendoza, and I am currently a junior. I spend most of my time focused on academics, either studying or completing my homework. During my free time, I enjoy reading, listening to music, going out for walks, and hanging out with friends. I am also intrigued by how the world and human mind works, so I tend to spend my time doing research and learning about my surroundings. I aspire to continue growing as a person.  </font> </p>
